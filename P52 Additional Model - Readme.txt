ISSUES:

- Power button needs pressing two or three times to pop up the shutdown menu
- Bluetooth shows as working, but doesn't see any devices
- Battery/AC indicator doesn't know when I put in or pull out the plug (indicator doesn't change) but battery level does rise or fall when draining or charging.
- No backlight keys (but backlight slider does work)
- I don't have the beautiful "About This Mac" customization you created!

I'll upload the EFI folder zip here.
If you can help me get things "perfect" I'd appreciate it!

Thanks,
David
